# Multivariate Localization Functions

This repo contains code used for the paper "Multivariate localization functions for strongly coupled data assimilation in the bivariate Lorenz '96 system" by Z. Stanley, I. Grooms, and W. Kleiber submitted to Nonlinear Processes in Geophysics. The figures in this paper can be recreated using the following code:

Figure 1 - "Plot_Functions.m"

Figure 2 - Left panel is created in tikz, right panel in "plot_snapshot.m"

Figure 3 - "HIST_UV_MV.m"

Figure B1 - "L96_EnKF_True_Cov.m"

Figure B2 - "figures_4functions_bXYto0.m"

Figure B3 - "plot_sensitivity_exp.m" & "plot_effective_taper_range.m"

Figure B4 - "plot_effective_taper_range.m"
